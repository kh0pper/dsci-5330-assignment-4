                <strong>TO:</strong><span>Board of Directors</span>
                <strong>FROM:</strong><span>Business Intelligence Team</span>
                <strong>DATE:</strong><span>October 22, 2025</span>

        <div class="content-section" id="executive-summary">
            <h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
            <p>Ford Motor Company's transformation under CEO Jim Farley exemplifies strategic management model evolution in the automotive industry's most disruptive period. This analysis applies <strong>Birkinshaw and Goddard's (2009) MIT Sloan management model framework</strong> and <strong>Nieto-Rodriguez's Strategy Implementation Roadmap</strong> to evaluate Ford's Ford+ plan execution and organizational effectiveness.</p>

            <div class="key-finding">
                <h4>Key Findings</h4>
                <p>Ford successfully transitioned from a traditional hierarchical management model (2020) to a <strong>hybrid approach</strong> balancing <strong>obliquity</strong> (purpose-driven mission) with <strong>goal setting</strong> (financial targets), <strong>intrinsic and extrinsic motivation</strong>, <strong>emergent and bureaucratic coordination</strong>, and <strong>collective wisdom with hierarchical oversight</strong> (2022-2025).</p>

                <p>The March 2022 organizational restructure into three business units—Ford Blue (ICE/hybrid), Ford Model e (EVs/software), and Ford Pro (commercial)—represents <strong>directed strategy</strong> creating conditions for <strong>emergent strategy</strong> within autonomous units.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Strategy implementation assessment:</strong> Overall score of <span class="rating">3.3/5.0</span>, indicating moderate effectiveness with significant variation. Leadership execution <span class="rating">(4/5)</span> and business model innovation <span class="rating">(4/5)</span> demonstrate strength, while employee engagement <span class="rating">(2/5)</span> represents critical weakness. Ford Pro's $9B EBIT (2024) validates the strategic approach, while Ford Model e's -$5.4B loss reveals execution challenges.</p>

            <div class="recommendation">
                <h4>Critical Recommendation</h4>
                <p>Ford must stabilize its management model on a sustainable hybrid approach, accelerate Model e profitability through a three-horizon strategy, and rebuild employee engagement to support cultural transformation. The February 2025 leadership changes—appointing Marin Gjaja as Chief Strategy Officer and John Lawler as Vice Chair-Strategy—signal recognition that business unit autonomy requires strategic coordination.</p>

            <h2>I. COMPANY OVERVIEW & STRATEGIC CONTEXT</h2>

            <h3>Ford's Market Position (2024)</h3>
            <p>Ford Motor Company ranks as America's #2 automaker with $185.0B revenue, 4.5 million wholesale units, and 171,000 employees globally. Founded in 1903, Ford pioneered mass production and the moving assembly line, establishing manufacturing practices that defined 20th-century industry.</p>

            <h3>Competitive Landscape Analysis: Porter's Five Forces</h3>

            <h4>Intensity of Competitive Rivalry (HIGH)</h4>
            <p>Traditional OEM competition from General Motors and Stellantis, EV disruptor Tesla with its direct-sales model and software expertise, and rising Asian manufacturers like Toyota (hybrid strength) and Hyundai-Kia create multi-front competitive battles. Ford's response—the three-business-unit structure—attempts focused competitive strategies rather than one-size-fits-all approaches.</p>

            <h4>Threat of New Entrants (MEDIUM-HIGH)</h4>
            <p>While capital barriers remain high ($8.5B R&D, 2024), the EV transition lowers entry barriers through simpler powertrains and fewer components. Ford's Ford+ plan emphasizes software and services differentiation to defend against new entrants.</p>

            <h4>Bargaining Power of Suppliers (MEDIUM-HIGH)</h4>
            <p>Limited EV battery manufacturers (LG, Samsung, CATL) and semiconductor shortages (2021-2023) demonstrate supplier power. Ford responds through vertical integration, including battery plants and supplier partnerships.</p>

            <h4>Bargaining Power of Buyers (MEDIUM)</h4>
            <p>Commercial customers (Ford Pro) wield significant fleet purchasing leverage, while retail customers have moderate power mitigated by brand loyalty. Ford's 9,006 dealerships (2024) provide customer access, though Model e explores direct-to-consumer sales.</p>

            <h4>Threat of Substitutes (MEDIUM-LOW)</h4>
            <p>Public transportation, ride-sharing (Uber, Lyft), and future autonomous mobility present substitute threats. Ford Next segment explores mobility solutions to address this force.</p>

            <h3>Strategic Inflection Points (2020-2025)</h3>

            <p><strong>October 2020: Jim Farley Becomes CEO</strong> — Replacing Jim Hackett, Farley brought marketing and product expertise from Toyota, signaling a shift toward product-focused, decisive leadership.</p>

            <p><strong>May 2021: Ford+ Plan Announcement</strong> — Farley unveiled Ford+ vision: "Help build a better world, where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams" through "must-have vehicles" and "always-on relationships" combining existing strengths with new capabilities. This represents <strong>oblique objectives</strong>—pursuing higher-order purpose to achieve profitability.</p>

            <p><strong>March 2022: Business Unit Restructuring</strong> — Ford reorganized into three customer-centered business units: Ford Blue ($75B revenue, $5.6B EBIT, 2024), Ford Model e ($7B revenue, -$5.4B EBIT), and Ford Pro ($53B revenue, $9B EBIT). Farley explained: "Creating separate but complementary businesses that give us startup speed and unbridled innovation in Ford Model e together with Ford Blue's industrial know-how." This exemplifies <strong>directed strategy</strong> (top-down reorganization) creating infrastructure for <strong>emergent strategy</strong> (unit-level innovation).</p>

            <p><strong>February 2025: Leadership Refinement</strong> — Ford appointed Sherry House as CFO (from investment banking), elevated John Lawler to Vice Chair-Strategy, and created a Chief Strategy Officer role for Marin Gjaja (25 years at BCG). These changes signal strategic recentralization after three years of business unit autonomy—recognizing that emergence requires oversight.</p>

            <h2>II. MANAGEMENT MODEL ANALYSIS</h2>

            <h3>Theoretical Framework</h3>
            <p>Birkinshaw and Goddard (2009) define management model as "choices made by top executives regarding how they define objectives, motivate effort, coordinate activities and allocate resources" (p. 81). They identify four dimensions, each with two polar approaches:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Objectives:</strong> Goal Setting (direct targets) ↔ Obliquity (higher-order purpose)</li>
                <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Extrinsic (compensation) ↔ Intrinsic (achievement, purpose)</li>
                <li><strong>Coordination:</strong> Bureaucracy (formal processes) ↔ Emergence (spontaneous self-organization)</li>
                <li><strong>Decision-Making:</strong> Hierarchy (top-down authority) ↔ Collective Wisdom (distributed knowledge)</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Dimension 1: Managing Objectives — From Goal Setting to Obliquity</h3>

            <p><strong>Pre-2021 Approach:</strong> Ford employed traditional goal setting with quarterly earnings focus and short-term profitability targets. The 2020 10-K emphasized "improving operating efficiency" and "cost reduction" without higher-order purpose.</p>

            <p><strong>2021-2024 Evolution:</strong> Ford+ introduced oblique objectives: "Help build a better world, where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams." This parallels IKEA's "better everyday life" approach that Birkinshaw and Goddard (2009) identified as achieving profitability indirectly through purpose. However, Ford balanced obliquity with direct goals—Ford Pro's $9B EBIT target and business unit P&L accountability maintained financial discipline.</p>

            <p><strong>2025 Recalibration:</strong> The $1B cost savings target and 2025 bonus cuts signal pendulum swinging from obliquity back toward goal setting. While necessary for financial discipline, this risks undermining the purpose-driven motivation that attracted talent to Model e's EV mission.</p>

            <h3>Dimension 2: Motivating Individuals — Balancing Extrinsic and Intrinsic</h3>

            <p>McGregor's (1960) Theory X assumes workers need extrinsic motivation (compensation, bonuses), while Theory Y emphasizes intrinsic motivation (achievement, purpose, peer recognition).</p>

            <p><strong>2021-2024 Balance:</strong> Ford+ introduced intrinsic elements: Model e's mission to "invent breakthrough EVs" attracted mission-driven engineers; the purpose statement "build a better world" appeared in every 10-K; and business unit P&L accountability created psychological ownership.</p>

            <p><strong>2025 Shift:</strong> Approximately 50% of middle managers lost stock bonuses as part of cost-cutting, projected to save $1B. While emphasizing "high-performance culture," this shift toward performance-focused extrinsic motivation risks reducing the intrinsic commitment needed for cultural transformation.</p>

            <h3>Dimension 3: Coordinating Activities — Emergence Through Business Units</h3>

            <p>Pre-2021, Ford operated through classic automotive hierarchy with centralized decision-making, functional silos (engineering, manufacturing, sales), and a single "Automotive segment" structure. Beginning in 2022-2024, the business unit structure enabled emergent coordination through three differentiated approaches: Ford Blue maintained autonomous P&L focused on cash generation from ICE vehicles using traditional manufacturing coordination, Ford Model e adopted startup-like autonomy for "unbridled innovation" with agile software development and rapid iteration, and Ford Pro developed commercial customer-centric solutions teams creating unique capabilities in fleet telematics and services.</p>

            <p>This aligns with Resource-Based View (Wernerfelt, 1984), which posits that business units develop distinctive capabilities—Pro's fleet software, Model e's battery technology, Blue's manufacturing scale—creating sustainable competitive advantage. Operations strategy concepts illuminate this approach: Blue achieves manufacturing scale while Pro leverages that infrastructure without duplicating facilities (economies of scale), and Model e is climbing the cost curve on EVs, still losing $5.4B but with improving per-unit costs (learning curve).</p>

            <p>By 2025, Gjaja's Chief Strategy Officer role coordinates strategy across units while units retain separate P&L, Frick's expanded role overseeing all three units signals integration opportunity, and Kay Hart's Model e position maintains operational focus. Ford successfully applied emergence principles through business unit autonomy, allowing differentiated coordination approaches, though the 2025 recentralization recognizes that emergence without strategic guardrails creates fragmentation—demonstrating adaptive management sophistication.</p>

            <h3>Dimension 4: Making Decisions — Collective Wisdom with Oversight</h3>

            <p>Pre-2021, Ford employed pure top-down decision-making with CEO-driven strategy, centralized approval processes, and limited delegation. From 2021-2024, Ford adopted collective wisdom within hierarchical oversight: business unit presidents made operational decisions with decentralized product planning and investment authority within unit P&L budgets, while Farley retained ultimate authority on capital allocation, overall EV investment ($50B commitment), and brand strategy. Ford Pro customer advisory councils informed product development (collective wisdom from end-users), while Farley's 2024 directive to slow some EV investments demonstrates hierarchical authority when strategic coherence requires it.</p>

            <p>The 2025 recentralization reflects further sophistication: Gjaja's CSO reporting to both Farley and Lawler creates a centralized strategy function, and Lawler's Vice Chair-Strategy role elevates strategic decisions above unit level, addressing the tension between <strong>speed</strong> (collective wisdom enables faster, customer-informed decisions) and <strong>coherence</strong> (hierarchical oversight prevents conflicting strategies). Effective management models balance both poles—Ford's 2022-2024 lean toward collective wisdom with 2025's correction toward hierarchy suggests the company is actively learning and adapting rather than rigidly adhering to one model.</p>

            <h3>Management Model Comparison</h3>

            <p>Ford's evolving management model reflects conscious choices across four critical dimensions. First, on objectives, the company balanced obliquity (purpose-driven mission) with goal setting (financial targets), shifting emphasis across periods as strategic needs changed. Second, regarding motivation, Ford moved from pure extrinsic compensation to a balanced approach incorporating intrinsic elements like purpose and innovation, though 2025 cost-cutting risks over-rotation back toward extrinsic pressure. Third, in coordination, Ford transitioned from traditional bureaucracy toward business unit emergence while maintaining strategic oversight. Finally, in decision-making, the company evolved from pure hierarchy toward collective wisdom and distributed leadership, then recentralized strategic decisions in 2025 to ensure coherence. This four-dimensional framework captures Ford's sophisticated management evolution.</p>

            <h2>III. STRATEGY FORMULATION & IMPLEMENTATION</h2>

            <h3>Ford+ Strategy Architecture</h3>
            <p><strong>Strategic Vision:</strong> "Help build a better world, where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams" (Ford Motor Company, 2025, p. 1).</p>

            <p>Ford's Ford+ strategy leverages three integrated pillars that combine its historic manufacturing strengths with emerging digital capabilities. The company's iconic brands—including the F-150, America's best-selling vehicle for 47 consecutive years—are reinforced by manufacturing scale reaching 4.5 million units annually and an extensive network of 9,006 dealerships. These existing strengths are augmented by new digital capabilities including advanced software platforms, vehicle connectivity, proprietary EV technology, and subscription-based services. These capabilities enable "always-on relationships" with customers through the FordPass app, over-the-air software updates that enhance vehicle features, and fleet management telematics that create recurring revenue streams. This integrated approach transforms Ford from a traditional vehicle manufacturer into a mobility and services company, addressing both consumer and commercial customer needs.</p>

            <h3>Strategy Implementation Roadmap Assessment</h3>
            <p>Nieto-Rodriguez notes: "Between 60-90% of organizations fail at strategy implementation." Ford's implementation across seven SIR pillars reveals both strengths and weaknesses.</p>

            <h4>Pillar 1: Leadership Execution (4/5) - Strategic Talent Analysis</h4>
            <p><strong>CEO Vision:</strong> Farley demonstrates "Level 5 Leader" characteristics—personal humility combined with professional will. Executive Chairman Bill Ford described him as "intensively competitive" and "a transformational leader."</p>

            <p><strong>Strategic Talent Deployment:</strong> The 2025 leadership changes demonstrate sophisticated talent strategy across the C-suite. Sherry House's appointment as CFO brings external investment banking experience that provides fresh financial perspective beyond traditional automotive finance. Marin Gjaja's creation as Chief Strategy Officer leverages 25 years at Boston Consulting Group to provide world-class strategy capability. John Lawler's elevation to Vice Chair-Strategy maintains long Ford tenure, providing institutional knowledge that balances external expertise with internal continuity. However, these rapid C-suite changes—six major roles in February 2025—create organizational uncertainty. Additionally, the 2023 UAW strike (46 days) indicates persistent labor-management tensions despite transformation rhetoric, suggesting that leadership excellence at the executive level has not yet translated into employee-level buy-in for the transformation.</p>

            <h4>Pillar 7: Performance Measurement (4/5)</h4>
            <p>Ford demonstrates industry-leading transparency by reporting business unit financials separately since 2022—most automakers (GM, Stellantis) don't explicitly break out EV losses. The company's measurement systems are comprehensive and multi-layered: business unit dashboards track EBIT, margins, subscription revenue, and customer retention; corporate KPIs monitor revenue, EBIT, net income, free cash flow, ROIC, market share, and customer satisfaction; real-time tracking monitors manufacturing KPIs, dealer inventory, and sales data; and a quarterly/annual cadence includes earnings calls with detailed segment breakdowns. However, strategic gaps remain: Ford lacks public employee engagement metrics and provides no clear EV profitability path timeline. These measurement systems represent excellent transparency and sophistication, but the strategic gaps prevent an excellent rating.</p>

            <h3>Business Unit Performance Analysis</h3>

            <h4>Ford Pro <span class="rating">5/5</span> — VALUE CREATION LEADER</h4>
            <p>Revenue grew 17.8% from $45B (2022) to $53B (2024) while EBIT increased 25% from $7.2B to $9B, yielding approximately 17% EBIT margin. Pro's value creation stems from software subscription revenue (telematics, fleet management), high-margin service contracts, and commercial customer loyalty. The integration of product (vehicles) with services (software) creates sustainable competitive advantage.</p>

            <h4>Ford Blue <span class="rating">3/5</span> — CASH COW IN DECLINE</h4>
            <p>Revenue declined 3.2% from $77.5B (2022) to $75.0B (2024), with EBIT falling 22.2% from $7.2B to $5.6B. Blue remains profitable but declining, facing the strategic challenge of balancing investment (maintain competitiveness) versus harvest (maximize cash for EV transition).</p>

            <h4>Ford Model e <span class="rating">1/5</span> — VALUE DESTRUCTION</h4>
            <p>Revenue grew 133% from $3.0B (2022) to $7.0B (2024), yet EBIT losses widened from -$2.1B to -$5.4B. Industry reports estimate $40,000-$50,000 per-unit losses. Scale is growing but unit economics are not improving, raising strategic questions about capital allocation.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; margin-top: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Competitive Context:</strong> Ford's financial recovery (Revenue +45.6%, EBIT swing from -$2.9B to +$11.3B) demonstrates effective management of profitability in a disruptive period. However, compared to competitors: General Motors maintains higher market share (17.1% vs Ford's 14.2%) while managing similar EBIT levels ($10.1B), suggesting Ford's profitability relies more heavily on Ford Pro's 17% margins. Toyota's revenue ($272B) and net income ($21.6B) remain substantially higher, reflecting its dominant position in hybrid and traditional vehicles. Ford's unit volume (4.5M) positions it competitively with GM (4.0M) but significantly below Toyota (9.6M), indicating market consolidation around EV transition leaders.</p>

                <h4>Strategy Implementation Summary</h4>
                <p>Ford demonstrates <strong>strong strategic planning</strong> (clear Ford+ vision, business unit structure) but <strong>uneven implementation execution</strong> (employee engagement low, Model e losses widening, stakeholder buy-in mixed). The 2025 leadership changes address strategic coherence across business units and could significantly improve implementation if successful.</p>
                <p><strong>Critical Risk:</strong> Employee engagement decline threatens the entire Ford+ plan. No strategy succeeds without a willing workforce.</p>

            <h2>IV. CHALLENGES & STRATEGIC RISKS</h2>

            <h3>Challenge 1: EV Transition Execution Gap</h3>
            <p>Ford Model e's -$5.4B EBIT loss (2024) with no clear profitability path creates strategic urgency. Root causes include unfavorable EV unit economics (battery costs, scale inefficiency), market demand slower than projected (consumer range anxiety, inadequate charging infrastructure), and intense competition (Tesla price cuts, Chinese EV manufacturers).</p>
            <p><strong>Strategic Dilemma:</strong> Continue funding losses or pivot strategy? Continuing risks exhausting shareholder patience; pivoting risks falling behind in critical technology transition.</p>

            <h3>Challenge 2: Cost Pressures and Restructuring Impacts</h3>
            <p>The $1B cost savings target requiring 2025 bonus cuts and potential layoffs creates management model tension. The shift from intrinsic motivation (purpose, innovation) to extrinsic pressure (performance, cost discipline) risks destroying cultural progress made 2021-2024.</p>

            <h3>Challenge 3: Labor Relations Complexity</h3>
            <p>The 2023 UAW strike (46 days) and ongoing wage negotiations occur as EV transition threatens ~30% job reductions in manufacturing. Union fears about job losses create resistance to the very strategy Ford needs for long-term competitiveness.</p>

            <h3>Challenge 4: Multi-Front Competitive Threats</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tesla:</strong> Direct-sales model (no dealer markup), software expertise, brand cachet. Cybertruck competes with F-150 Lightning.</li>
                <li><strong>Chinese OEMs (BYD, NIO, Geely):</strong> Low-cost EVs with government support. If Chinese EVs enter U.S., price competition intensifies.</li>
                <li><strong>Traditional OEMs (GM, Stellantis, Toyota):</strong> Similar challenges, similar strategies create commodity competition risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Tech Companies (Apple, Google):</strong> Mobility software, autonomous technology potentially reduce vehicles to commodity platforms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Strategic Risk:</strong> Ford stuck in middle—unable to match Tesla innovation, Chinese cost, or Toyota quality.</p>

                <h4>Recommendation 4: Leverage Ford Pro Success for Competitive Differentiation</h4>
                <p><strong>Issue:</strong> Ford Pro is star performer ($9B EBIT) but underleverage for competitive advantage.</p>
                <p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Expand Pro Model to Blue:</strong> Apply software/services approach to consumer vehicles; develop subscription telematics for F-150 retail</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrated EV Solutions:</strong> Bundle Model e commercial EVs with Pro fleet software; offer charging infrastructure as service</li>
                    <li><strong>B2B2C Strategy:</strong> Use Pro commercial relationships to reach consumer customers; fleet drivers as brand ambassadors</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Monetization:</strong> Aggregate anonymized fleet data for urban planning insights; predictive maintenance services</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Expected Outcome:</strong> Ford Pro differentiates Ford from all competitors—none have equivalent commercial/software integration—creating sustainable competitive "moat." Ford Pro EBIT: $9B (2024) → $11B (2026).</p>

            <h2>VI. CONCLUSION</h2>

            <p>Ford Motor Company's management and strategy transformation (2020-2025) demonstrates both the <strong>promise and peril</strong> of management model innovation in legacy industry disruption.</p>

            <h3>Key Findings Summary</h3>
            <p>Using Birkinshaw and Goddard's (2009) MIT Sloan framework, Ford evolved from pure hierarchy (2020) to hybrid emergence (2022-2024) to balanced integration (2025), showing management sophistication through experimentation, learning, and adaptation. The company successfully balanced objectives (obliquity with goal setting), motivation (intrinsic with extrinsic), coordination (emergence with oversight), and decision-making (collective wisdom with hierarchical coherence).</p>

            <p>Applying Nieto-Rodriguez's Strategy Implementation Roadmap, Ford scores 3.3/5.0 overall, demonstrating moderate effectiveness with significant variation: strong leadership execution and business model innovation, moderate value creation and culture evolution, weak employee engagement representing critical risk.</p>

            <div class="key-finding">
                <h4>Performance Paradox</h4>
                <p>Ford Pro ($9B EBIT, 2024) validates strategy; Ford Model e (-$5.4B loss) reveals execution difficulty; Ford Blue (22% EBIT decline) indicates core business pressure. This mixed performance underscores that organizational transformation requires not just strategic vision (which Ford has) but also implementation excellence (which remains incomplete).</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Future Outlook Assessment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best Case (35% probability):</strong> Model e breakeven 2027; Ford Pro $12B+ EBIT; employee engagement rebounds; stock $18-20; management model stabilizes as competitive advantage</li>
                <li><strong>Most Likely (50% probability):</strong> Model e losses narrow (-$2B 2027); Ford Pro strong ($10-11B); engagement challenged (3/5); stock $12-14; management model continues seeking balance</li>
                <li><strong>Downside (15% probability):</strong> Model e strategic pivot; UAW strike disrupts; talent exodus; stock $6-8; management model reverts to hierarchy</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Final Assessment</h3>
            <p>Ford's management model transformation is <strong>ambitious and necessary</strong>. The automotive industry's transition to EVs, software, and services requires new organizational capabilities that traditional hierarchical structures cannot provide. Ford's experiment with business unit autonomy, balanced motivation, and collective wisdom represents genuine management innovation.</p>

            <p>However, implementation challenges are significant. The 2025 cost-cutting measures risk undoing cultural progress. Model e losses test shareholder patience. Employee engagement decline threatens human capital transformation requires.</p>

            <p>The 2025 leadership changes demonstrate recognition of these challenges. By adding strategic oversight while maintaining business unit structure, Ford attempts to capture benefits of both emergence and coherence. As Drucker (1994) noted, "The theory of the business must be known and understood throughout the organization" (p. 95). Ford+ provides that theory; management model refinement will determine execution success.</p>

                <h4>Ultimate Verdict</h4>
                <p>Ford's management and strategy transformation is <strong>partially effective (3.2/5.0 overall)</strong> with <strong>significant upside potential</strong> if recommendations are implemented. The next 18-24 months (2025-2026) will determine whether Ford+ becomes a case study in transformation success or cautionary tale of strategic ambition exceeding organizational capability.</p>
                <p>Success requires not choosing between traditional and modern management approaches, but rather finding sustainable balance between goal-setting and obliquity, extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, bureaucracy and emergence, hierarchy and collective wisdom.</p>
                <p>As Birkinshaw and Goddard (2009) conclude: "There is no one best management model" (p. 90). Ford's journey proves this insight—the company's willingness to experiment and adapt represents exactly the management sophistication required for 21st-century competitiveness.</p>
